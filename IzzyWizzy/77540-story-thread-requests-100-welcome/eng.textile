Hey everyone! I know it’s been such a long time since I last posted on this site and believe me, I feel terribly about how long I’ve been MIA, but I would like to make a new promise of trying to get all the requests and commissions completed, my schedule is usually so straight and on point that I didn’t really know how to balance this and other things the past two months when it sort of got sent into orbit, so to speak, but I’m accepting requests for stories in any case, and its completely free, too! as I don’t particularly feel like I should need to be paid to write about what I enjoy

I’m familiar with all sorts, especially shows like stranger things and such, and anime is also another good one, I know stuff like SAO, AOT, Avatar, all sorts!

The eleven one could be interesting and would work as MBB is eighteen now, but yeah, I know Gravity Falls!
