Hey everyone! I know! It’s been a while since I posted here, but I have a lot of writing muse lately, today in particular! And I was wondering if anyone would like to see a new, original story! That I’ll break up into chapters and such, but I think it’d be fun, nonetheless!

I know, right!? I’ve honestly missed writing them, i’m gonna try create a full fledged story with this one, but i’m a bit stuck, would you mind if i PM you, and maybe run some ideas and stuff by you, or actually, i’d love to hear any ideas you might have, too!!
