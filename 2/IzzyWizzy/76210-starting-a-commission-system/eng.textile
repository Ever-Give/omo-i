Hey, ya’ll! I was thinking of starting a commission system with my stories where you can ask me to write a story about or for something, OCS or canon characters are both allowed!

PM me for more details, or just send me a message in this thread and I’ll try my best to get back to everyone!

Yeah, almost anything, you can PM me for more details on what i’m willing to write, and it’s free, if that’s what you mean!
