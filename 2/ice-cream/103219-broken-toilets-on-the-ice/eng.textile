I was travelling on an ice a while back and discovered that majority of the toilets were either out of order or occupied most of the time, this seems to be a regular thing and tendency for DB so i was thinking of writing a short story about it, do u guys have any ideas for the main plot (or special events) for the story or a name for the main character, im already working on the plot and would love to spice things up!! ^^
